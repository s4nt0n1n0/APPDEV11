                            Second year really hits hard, especially with the heavy workload where every task also requires
                            in-depth studying. Despite the pressure, this year has been the most enjoyable for me so far.

                            I have come to understand myself better and realized that I genuinely enjoy my course and subjects.
                            I especially enjoy building systems in our Information Management (IM) subject,
                            learning proper usability, interface design, and user experience principles in HCI,
                            and developing applications in App Development.

                        <p>
                            Completing our applications has been very fulfilling, and I am grateful that our instructor
                            provided us with proper learning materials, which helped me understand the development process

                        <p>
                            I was initially unable to pass CNSC when I first took the exam, but I remained determined to study here due to our financial situation.
                            Through perseverance, I became one of the ten qualifiers accepted via transfer.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Entering CNSC was intimidating. Coming from a small school, I struggled with insecurity, anxiety,
                            and self-doubt during my first semester—especially without a proper laptop.
                            Managing academic workloads was overwhelming, and I often felt inadequate.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During the second semester, I gradually became more comfortable. Although the lack of proper equipment
                            continued to stress me until midterms, I was finally able to acquire a laptop afterward.
                            With the shift to in-person classes, I completed my tasks more effectively and successfully passed
                            all my major subjects.

                        <p>
                            I built my first projects and discovered my passion for creating interactive systems using
                            C++ and Java. I also created my first static website using only HTML.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When I first entered ACLC, I was very nervous because I didn't know what to do.
                            I didn't have a proper laptop at the time, which made studying difficult due to limited materials.
                            Fortunately, the school had a well-equipped computer laboratory that helped me complete
                            my projects and activities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I cried almost every night because I couldn't pass some activities, and my code would not run
                            because it was full of errors. However, I am grateful for those struggles because they helped
                            me develop a critical and logical mindset in debugging and problem-solving.
